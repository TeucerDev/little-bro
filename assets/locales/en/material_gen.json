A real shame, of course, that it looks so very majestic. As such, it lost the nickname \"Descendant of Dragons,\" and is now termed the \"False Dragon\" instead."

In terms of pure fighting capability, it is even a match for smaller sea monsters and has thus been given the nickname \"Ironbone Dragon\" in honor of its strength, which is considered the backbone of its species' future revitalization."
