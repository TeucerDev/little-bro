    "description": "Weapon Ascension Material.\\n\"Sumirezome Sangetsu Kogetsukan\" depicts the fierce oni Torachiyo shattering the Shogun's naginata with a single bite, thus gaining the upper hand for a time. As such, masks that are based on him have finely crafted fangs.\\nIn the denouement of this tale, the wounded oni fled into the forest, deathly afraid of showing himself even to the cold moonlight. The wind that whispers through the alleys and valleys can be said to resemble his quiet cries of agony, and so there is a poetic seasonal expression for this in Inazuma: \"Torachiyo's Wind.\""

    "description": "Weapon Ascension Material.\\nIn the lost songs of the oni nursemaids, Torachiyo was an elegant young man, strong of body and fair of face. He was once a beloved lieutenant of the Shogun, and he followed her into the dark abyssal realms to repel the defiled ones, winning renown for the oni, whose blood thinned with each passing day.\\nNone now sing these songs, but the mask of a horned oni, even in a different form, still possesses power beyond the norm."

    "description": "Weapon Ascension Material.\\nChiyo, a warrior of the oni tribe with the Electro Mitsudomoe emblem emblazoned on her back, was once swallowed whole by a beast from beyond this world that had a tiger's body and a serpent's tail while holding back the forces of darkness. At last, she tore the creature's innards apart from within, breaking free.\\nThis is the origin of the phrase \"Chiyo the Tiger-Bite,\" and would be changed over many years to \"Torachiyo.\"\\nBut within the belly of the beast, she was stained by a deep sin and saw her comrades ripped to shreds by those blood-red teeth. Steeped in darkness as far as the eye could see, she would eventually draw her sword upon the Almighty Narukami Ogosho. Her sword-arm and one horn would be cloven, and she would flee from the city into the forest like a wounded beast. There, they say that she was taken for some unknown monster and slain by the tengu, or perhaps by the Shuumatsuban — or perhaps by a scion of the Iwakura Clan training deep in the mountains, for her features had been twisted by hatred and the agony of her wounds. Or perhaps she even met the oni-masked, sword-bearing doll near the corpse of the giant serpent, and there ended her life's journey.\\nFew among those who fought against the abyss in those days were spared pitch-dark dreams. Those who slew monsters and then became them were hardly the minority. The border between worlds grows fragile, and corruption of this kind is perhaps not merely monodirectional."

Only the descendants in the yellow sand chose to follow their god. Even as the grim shadow of calamity loomed, the power in which they had faith shone brightly like amber and gold.\\nYet calamity befell nonetheless, and the golden insectoid insignias were buried beneath the depths of shrine and palace, under collapsed pillars engraved with images of eagles and bulls."

    "name": "Rusty Koi",
    "description": "A large fish said to be the descendant of dragons.\\nThis is a variant species of Koi, and is sometimes termed the \"awakened dragon\" amongst them. In stark contrast to its rather shabby appearance, the Rusty Koi has shed its opulent gold tabard in exchange for a hard armor of rusty bronze. Very strong-willed, it will fight any interloper that dares to steal its food or enter its territory. In terms of pure fighting capability, it is even a match for smaller sea monsters and has thus been given the nickname \"Ironbone Dragon\" in honor of its strength, which is considered the backbone of its species' future revitalization."

During their courtship phase, an observer might bear witness to the curious sight of males and females of this species blasting each other with these water cannons. Perhaps passing on the bitterness of life is also a manifestation of love."

Due to their hard scales and big size, Axe Marlins are able to handle attacks from other aquatic creatures, waiting until their attacker is exhausted and leaves.\\nTheir strength can also prove challenging for a master fisherman, whose only choice is to treat them as large beasts — to drain their stamina more efficiently and eventually catch them, one must go all out the moment an Axe Marlin bites."

This effect only works in Mondstadt.\\n\\nA long, bright, transparent rod created by a poet from Mondstadt. To help borrow the power of Anemo to help raise the rod, the poet rather ingeniously designed a fishing reel made from the leaves of Windwheel Asters, which also imparts a certain romanticism of \"lingering in the wind\" to this device. But perhaps there were issues in the handiwork or in the design itself, for the finalized product could not spin as freely as expected. Perhaps this is what they call \"the chasm between professions?\""

This effect only works in Liyue.\\n\\nA long rod that stands like elegant bamboo. It is said to have been constructed and kept by a skilled hermit from Liyue, and it was first discovered on a stone tablet with the following words carved upon it: \"O you who aspire, take up this rod,\" like a legendary sword waiting for a hero to pull it out. Of course, you only ever hear this glorious origin story from the mouths of merchants, so it may just be some rhetoric used to increase the item's value... But those who know this and still use this rod can only be those who are ready and willing to accept this pact."

This effect only works in Inazuma.\\n\\nA rod created to commemorate the ancient Ukai, or Cormorant, fishing method. The ruby-red gem at the tip of the rod represents the tinder used by the cormorant fishers, and the bird ornaments along the rod's shaft represent the cormorants themselves, who helped the hard-working Inazumans pass through those cataclysmic years. This low-efficiency fishing method has long become obsolete, but the persevering, pioneering spirit has been passed down together with this rod."

If you leave the Ideal Tension Zone, the acceleration will reset.\\nA special fishing rod created for the sake of the Lunar Leviathan. To tackle this legendary fish, the creator of this rod specially added some material with rare functions onto the rod itself and the fishing line, giving it both great malleability and tensile strength. Of course, such a treasure could easily catch ordinary fish, but that seems like overkill to the point where even the rod might feel ashamed to be used thus."

Under its pure aesthetics, it seems to have some meaning related to \"life\" — it is said that the oldest fishing rod of Sumeru was a branch wrapped with vines, and many master anglers achieved miraculous catches with such rods. Today's fishermen also believe that such fishing rods with long histories will bring them good luck."
